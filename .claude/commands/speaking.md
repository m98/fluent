Hallo the learner!

Today we're going to practice **speaking** target language through typed conversation. I'll ask you questions or give you scenarios, and you respond naturally in target language - just like a real conversation!

**Focus:** Natural expression, fluency, pronunciation (typed)
**Level:** A2 (everyday conversations)
**Duration:** 15-20 minutes

**Tips:**
- Think in target language, not English!
- Don't worry about perfect grammar - focus on communication
- Use complete sentences
- Try to be natural and conversational

**Ready? Let's chat!** 💬
